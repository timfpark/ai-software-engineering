Another common task in software engineering is to modernize an application. It is not uncommon to have legacy code in an organization that we want to migrate to a modern approach.

Two examples of this are captured here:

- [Motif to React](./motif-to-react/): Using AI to help us migrate a very old legacy Motif X11 application to a modern React web application.
- [COBOL to Java](./cobol-to-java/): Using AI to help us migrate a very old COBOL report generation application to Java.
