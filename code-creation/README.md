# Code Creation

This section demonstrates how to use AI to accelerate the creation of code artifacts.

## Deserialization Rust structs from JSON Payload

In the [flights](./flights) exercise, we see how AI can help us automate the labor of decomposing
complex artifacts into code artifacts.

Concretely, we show through how to take a complex JSON payload
and build Rust structs that can deserialize it and how we can continue the conversation to also
generate PostgreSQL tables that persist it in 1/100th the time.
