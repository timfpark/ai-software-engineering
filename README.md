# Key Patterns: Software Engineering with Github Copilot

## Understanding a Codebase

We often have to work in existing codebases and one of the key pieces of friction we encounter when we do that is understanding the work of engineers that came before us.

The [code-understanding](./code-understanding/) folder contains an example of using Github Copilot to help get a better understanding of the structure of a file from the Linux kernel.

## Code Generation

Of course, one of the core activities of any software engineer is code generation. In this new world, this activity has shifted from being one in which the software engineer is essentially emitting the output of an internal monologue to one where they are having a conversation with an AI pair programmer about the artifact that they would like to exist.

The [code-generation](./code-generation/) folder contains an exercise to help you build intuition around this.

## Application Modernization

Another common task in Software Engineering is to modernize an application. It is not uncommon to have legacy code in an organization that we want to migrate to a modern approach.

In [app-modernization](./app-modernization/), we will show how we can use Github Copilot to help us migrate a very old legacy Motif X11 application to a modern React web application.
