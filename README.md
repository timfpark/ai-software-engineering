# Software Engineering with AI

## Codebase Understanding

We often have to work in existing codebases, and one of the key pieces of friction we encounter is understanding the work of engineers that came before us.

The [code-understanding](./code-understanding/) folder contains an example of using GitHub Copilot to help get a better understanding of the function of a source code file from the Kubernetes project.

## Application Modernization

Another common task in software engineering is to modernize an application. It is not uncommon to have legacy code in an organization that we want to migrate to a modern approach.

In [app-modernization](./app-modernization/), two examples of this are captured here:

- [Motif to React](./app-modernization/motif-to-react/): Using AI to help us migrate a very old legacy Motif X11 application to a modern React web application.
- [COBOL to Java](./app-modernization/cobol-to-java/): Using AI to help us migrate a very old COBOL report generation application to Java.

## Code Creation

Of course, one of the core activities of any software engineer is creating new code. In this new AI world, this activity has shifted from being one in which the software engineer is essentially emitting the output of an internal monologue in the form of code to one where they are having a conversation with an AI pair programmer about the artifact they would like to exist.

The [code-creation](./code-creation/) folder contains exercises to help you build intuition around how the world has shifted from coding to conversations while creating new software artifacts.

## Toil Reduction

There are a litany of other small places there applications of AI can result in huge productivity improvements:
